# CCNA Labs: Access Control Lists (ACL) 🚀

This section of my **CCNA Labs Repository** focuses on **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**—a crucial aspect of network security and traffic management. These labs demonstrate how to configure and apply **Standard, Extended, and Named ACLs** to control network access effectively.

## 🔹 Topics Covered:
- **Standard ACLs** – Filtering traffic based on source IP  
- **Extended ACLs** – Advanced filtering based on protocol, source, and destination  
- **Named ACLs** – Custom ACLs for better readability and management  
- **Applying ACLs** – Configuring ACLs on interfaces and VTY lines  
- **Troubleshooting ACLs** – Debugging and verifying ACL rules  

## 🛠️ Skills Developed:
✔ Implementing ACLs to **enhance network security**  
✔ Controlling traffic flow for **better network management**  
✔ Filtering access to **sensitive resources**  
✔ Troubleshooting ACL misconfigurations

# Objective
Block all traffic from the network address 10.16.0.0/24 on R1.
## Note 
This lab uses the same network setup as the "Standard ACLs Lab". I'll repeat some of the steps, providing a summarized version below. Please check "Standard ACLs Lab" as needed. 
## The similar steps
Access the network: PC10's IP address is 10.16.0.10, and the default gateway is 10.16.0.1; Router R1's interface g0/0 IP address is 10.16.6.5, and no access list was configured.
